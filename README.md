##Description
I created a simple password generator that will create a random password based on certain criteria

##Functionality
When user clicks the "generate password button" they are presented with a javascript modal that prompts for password criteria. The password must include lowercase, uppercase, a special character and a number all within 8-128 characters. User's input is validated to ensure a secure and generated password that matches that required criteria for the password.
